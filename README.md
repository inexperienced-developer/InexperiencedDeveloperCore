# Inexperienced Developer Core Unity Package
A collection of common scripts, utils, and extensions I include in most projects. It's an ever-growing, ever-changing list. Not comprehensive by any means. Probably needs more love.

## Install Directly to Unity
_Must make sure that you have git installed_
* Go to Window -> Package Manager
* Click the plus in the top left of the Package Manager Window
* Add package from git URL
* Paste (https://github.com/inexperienced-developer/com.inexperienced-developer.core.git)
* Click Add

Files can also just be downloaded and dragged into your project.
